 <p align="center">If you’re a visitor (or sometime even a resident) of this beautiful island, it’s natural to feel confused and get lost in the hustle and bustle of the city and beyond without actually getting the chance to enjoy its many facets. thingstodo.lk is a one stop shop to get information on things to do which covers experiences, things to see, places to visit, what to eat &amp; drink, where to stay, fun stuff for kids and what to shop, basically to get the most out of your time spent in this wonderful island. Dream Park is a mall with a history – quite well known for its Millenium Park glory days, and for bringing fake snow to Sri Lanka in December. It’s got everything: a food court, a bowling alley, a children’s play park, a pub/restaurant, a pool parlour, a gaming arena,water park and many events.</p>
